# Mitsubishi Outlander Logs

Some CANbus logs from a crashed but driveable Mitsubishi Outlander 2019 (ACAS model). Work in progress.

Logs are in GVRET CSV format for [SavvyCAN](https://savvycan.com/).

To get around GitHub repo file size limits, this repo uses [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/)

Most logs have coarse SavvyCAN timestamp in the READMEs. These are based on videos that I haven't put in the repo (too big). If you're unsure about what happens at a particular time then you can open an Issue and ask me to check the video, I'll see what I can do.

* ev-bmu/ is captures taken on EV CANbus and BMU CANbus simultaneously.
* scripts/ is some useful Python 3 scripts
